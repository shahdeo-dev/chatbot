Description
Built a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents, ask natural-language questions, and receive AI-generated answers. The system extracts text from PDFs, chunks the content, generates embeddings via OpenAI, stores them in a vector store, and retrieves contextually relevant information in real-time.

Key Features
PDF Upload & Processing – Built with Java (Spring Boot) and PDFBox, supporting multi-page documents.

Text Chunking & Vector DB – Implements custom chunking logic with overlap to preserve context; integrates embeddings and vector search via Spring AI.

AI-Powered Answer Generation – Utilizes GPT-3.5 Turbo for natural-language responses based on retrieved context.

Interactive Frontend – Fast and responsive React UI for PDF upload, query input, and result display.

Deployment Ready – Easily containerizable backend + frontend for local or cloud deployment.

Skills Demonstrated
Java (Spring Boot), React, REST APIs

PDF parsing (Apache PDFBox)

Embeddings, Vector Databases, LLM Integration (through Spring AI/OpenAI)

Full-stack development and seamless UX design

Contributors
[Gaurav Shahdeo] – Sole developer on backend logic, frontend UI, and overall integration.

Context & Motivation
This project originated from a need to intelligently interact with static PDF content—such as lecture notes, reports, or manuals—via conversational queries. It’s an exploration of how RAG can bridge the gap between documents and chatbot interfaces.

Why It Stands Out
Real-World Utility: Adapts static files into dynamic, queryable interfaces—useful in education, compliance, and enterprise domains.

Practical AI Integration: Combines file I/O, vector search, and LLM capabilities in a unified full-stack application.

Clean Design: Lightweight, intuitive UI that gets users talking to their documents with minimal friction.
