Title: PDF-Powered Chatbot with Java Backend & Web UI

Description (≈350 words):

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions, and receive AI-powered responses—powered by a Java backend and a modern frontend interface.

What It Does
Users can upload one or more PDF files and enter questions via the UI. The backend extracts text from the PDFs, splits it into manageable chunks, generates embeddings using OpenAI’s API, and stores them in a vector database. When a question is asked, the system performs a similarity search on the vector store to find relevant context and then queries an LLM to produce an informed answer.

Why It Matters
This tool bridges the gap between static documents and conversational interaction. By combining PDF processing with retrieval-augmented generation, it enables semantic search and real-time Q&A based on your own documents—ideal for creating intelligent assistants and personal knowledge bases.

Key Technologies & Components
Java Backend: Built with Spring Boot, leveraging PDFBox for text extraction.

Vector Search: Utilizes embeddings (via Spring AI/OpenAI) and a vector datastore (e.g., Redis, Elasticsearch).

LLM Integration: Employs OpenAI’s GPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo) to generate answers.

Frontend UI: Simple and responsive interface for file upload, question input, and answer display.

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository.

Set your environment variable for OPENAI_API_KEY.

Build and run the Spring Boot application:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn spring-boot:run
Navigate to http://localhost:8080, upload a PDF, ask questions, and get answers instantly.

Contribution & Roadmap
Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests. Future features may include:

Support for multiple PDFs per session.

Enhanced chunking strategies.

Configurable LLM parameters via UI.

Exporting Q&A sessions or analytics.
